            <h2>Injustice Gods Among Us</h2>
            <p>
               I loved the game Injustice as it has Heroes and Villians from DC, like Batman, Superman, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Joker, Deathstroke, Lex Luthor, Sinestro, and more. The story takes place in an alternate dimension where Joker destroys Metropolis with a nuclear bomb and tricks Superman of killing his wife and his unborn son. Superman finds Joker and kills him and rebuilts Metropolis and becomes high councilor of Earth. Batman sees Superman as a threat and forms a team resistance to stop Superman but Batman has only few allies as Superman has lot more allies than him. Batman goes to another dimension where the bomb didn't go off and teleport Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Arrow, and Green Lantern, unfortuantly other dimension BAtman and Joker were teleported by accident. The game is available on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3,PS4, and Wii U.

            <h2>Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham</h2>

                I liked this game as it is in lego form and the setting this time is in space and not in Gotham by the title. The heroes and villians teamed up to stop Brainiac after he captures seven Lantern Corps including Green Lantern. He shrinks the Earth using their power and the heroes and villians have to regrow Earth back to its original size.

                I always was a fan of the game since it had good graphics at the same time.This takes place in Gotham during Christmas Eve where Batman is placed on a bounty by Black Mask he assasinators: Killer Croc, Deathstroke, Deadshot, Copperhead, Shiva, Electrocutioner, and Firefly. But it turns out it was Joker who placed the bounty on him in disguise of Black Mask. Same time Batman is a criminal by the Gotham City Police Department. He was consider criminal by police commisioner Jim Gordon.
