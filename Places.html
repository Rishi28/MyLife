            One of my favourite places to visit is New York City's One World Trade Center also called as The Freedom Tower. It is the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan, New York City. It is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere. The tower has the same name as the original WTC, which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The tower is built upon a 185 foot tall windowless concrete base, designed to protect it from ground level attacks. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials and it has rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems.

              One of the recent places I visited and definitely will be one of my favourite destination is 'The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter'. It is situated at the Universal Orlando and Islands Of Adventure, Flroida. Both parks include Hogwarts Express stations allowing passengers to take the train reach both parks aboard the full scale model of the train that appears in the film series. The main attractions are Harry Potter and the Forbidden journey, Dragon Challenge which is part of inverted roller coasters, Harry Potter the escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride and ofcourse the famous Wand shop. It will definitely give you a thrilling and exciting experience if you enjoy the books or movies of Harry Potter. 

              Small note : To avoid long lines, use single rider option :)

               One of the place i am looking forward to visit is the 50th state of America Hawaii. I heard and read about the scenery, warm tropical climate, active volcanoes and lots of beautiful beaches of the place which can provide lots of fun. It is made up of many tiny islands and am eagerly waiting to visit them along with the boiling pots of Wailuku.
